## Make dreams a reality with AutoAI

Try AutoAI to simplify data analysis. Generate answers and make quick & fast thoughts. No manual needed. Experience the future of analytics and say hello to innovation.

I build this app because I was tired of using ChatGPT for certain things with coding whilst it was in a waitlist. I wanted to use a more efficient and accurate tool. However, ChatGPT always has been the #1 tool and I wanted to inovate new things with a new take on AI. So I build this app to solve these problems. Hope you enjoy it.

## Features
- [x] Not as bias as you think, we try to be fair with everyone.
- [x] Frequent changes, we try and use your feedback to imporve.
- [x] Waiting? No need. We made a tool 24/7 and free to use even with 100 people.
- [x] Ask questions without a hesitation, and get a fairly well answer. 
(WIP: Sometimes the API would like to break, or not generate an answer. The simple fix is to either refresh and try again with your prompt or report it on our Github.)
